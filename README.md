## BITCOIN-CLI WRAPPER AND BITCOIN-RELATED SCRIPTS

These scripts wrap `bitcoin-cli` (bitcoind) and try to parse data.
They are transaction-centred.

_Make sure bitcoin-dameon is **fully synchonised**_, otherwise some
functions may not work properly!

___Tip___: have bitcoind set with transaction indexes (option 'txindex=1'),
otherwise user must supply block id hash manually plus
some vin transaction information is not going to be retrievable.

Depends on `bitcoin-cli` _RPC_ call output.
That is good as we can be dependable on a set of minimally-parsed data
to start with.

These wrapper scripts require `bash`, `bitcoin-cli` and `jq`.
Some scripts have got [grondilu's bitcoin-bash-tools](https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools)
functions embedded.

Transaction parsing time really depends on the number of
vins and vouts. Parsing a few hendred or thousand transactions
seems quite feasible for personal use. `bitcoin.tx.sh` has got option -f, which is fast and delivers basic transaction info.

SCRIPT NAME | DESCRIPTION

__bitcoin.blk.sh__ | Bitcoin block information and functions
__bitcoin.hx.sh__ | Create base58 address types from public key and WIF from private keys
__bitcoin.tx.sh__ |  Parse transactions by hash or transaction json data
__blockchair.btcoutputs.sh__ |  Download blockchair output dump files systematically, see also [this repo](https://github.com/mountaineerbr/bitcoin-all-addresses)
__zzz.bitcoin.parsedTxs..__ | Example of parsed transactions from block 638200

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

If I were to write these scripts from ground up again, they would be much different (hopefully simpler and faster).
Time for maintaining them became scarse and ended, now moving onto other things.
